# GKM-graphs-homology
This repository stores the code that I used to study topology of matrix spaces, Hessenberg varieties, and GKM-theory. Everything is written in Sage, so one can execute calculations in Sagemath cell.

Comment 1: There exists a better inductive formula for Betti numbers of Hess. varieties (needed in Characteristics_of_Hess_Varieties.ipynb), which avoids running through all permutations. The formula appeared in https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11580 and have not been implemented yet.
